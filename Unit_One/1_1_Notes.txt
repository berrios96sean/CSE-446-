// Service Standards and Service Development 

Three levels of a System 
    - Architecture -- Overall orginization
    - Interfaces -- I/O 
    - Behaviours -- Declarative or Procedural relationship between I/O 

// Some Vocab 
    - Service Orientation (SO): Includes all Service Oriented approaches SOA, SOC, SOD 
    - Service Oriented Architecture (SOA): Software consisting of a collection of loosely coupled and platform-
    independent services that interact with each other through standard interfaces. SOA does not concern developing 
    operational software.
    - Sevice Oriented Computing (SOC): refers to the paradigm that represents computation in SOA. SOC concerns 
    interface and behavior, including communication protocols, algorithms, and data representations.
