// Service Standards and Service Development 

Three levels of a System 
    - Architecture -- Overall orginization
    - Interfaces -- I/O 
    - Behaviours -- Declarative or Procedural relationship between I/O 

// Some Vocab 
    - Service Orientation (SO): Includes all Service Oriented approaches SOA, SOC, SOD 
    - Service Oriented Architecture (SOA): Software consisting of a collection of loosely coupled and platform-
    independent services that interact with each other through standard interfaces. SOA does not concern developing 
    operational software.
    - Sevice Oriented Computing (SOC): refers to the paradigm that represents computation in SOA. SOC concerns 
    interface and behavior, including communication protocols, algorithms, and data representations.
    - NOTE: SOA and SOC can be used alternatively if the entire system is concerned, without specifically referring to architecture, 
    interface, or behavior.
    - Service Oriented Development (SOD):  concerns the entire software development life cycle based on SOA concepts and SOC paradigm. 
     involves current technologies and tools to effectively produce operational software:
     Programming language features, 
     Development environments: VS, Java EE, WebSphere;
     Standards and Interfaces with components, services, and data sources;
     Deployment and hosting environment: Self-Hosting, Servers, AWS hosting, Cloud Infrastructure, such as Google App Engine, MS Azure, etc.

// Web Services 
    - interface that describes a collection of operations (Web methods) that are Web-accessible through standardized XML messaging
     WSDL (Web Service Description Language) is used to describe the interface;
     SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is used to exchange messages between services and between the applications and services;
     SOAP is typically on HTTP (others are possible)
     UDDI and ebXML are used for service registration/publishing
    XML: Is a format of data/i/o representation that can be used by almost all services 
    -- NOTE: A web service that uses both SOAP and WSDL is call a SOAP Service 

// RESTful Services 
     REST: Representational State Transfer
     A RESTful service is an interface that describes a collection of resources that are Web-accessible through standardized resource representations
     URI (Uniformed Resource Identifier) is used to access the resource under the Web;
     HTTP (Hypertext Transport Protocol) is used to exchange messages between services and between the applications and services;
     RESTful services use one layer of protocol less (without SOAP), and HTTP is even more widely used.
     RESTful services use multiple resource representation languages for representing input and output data:
     XML, HTML, XHTML, RSS Feed, Atom Feed, JSON
     Does not deal with object types, and less related to OO
