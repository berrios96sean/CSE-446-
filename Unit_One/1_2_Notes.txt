// WCF Service Development and Consuming 
     ASP .Net is a component in Visual Studio for service and application development.     
     It can be used for service development (.asmx service)
     It is mainly used for application development
     WCF is a component in Visual Studio
     WCF is used for service development only (.svc service)
     It is used for developing SOAP as well as RESTful services
     WCF service hosting: with or without IIS
     Service Interfaces: Both .asmx and .svc services use WSDL
     WCF service consuming
     Console application 
     ASP .Net Windows forms application (Desktop application)
     ASP .Net Website (Web application) / HTML5 Website
     Workflow Foundation
     BPEL, and many others
    -- NOTE: Section 3.1 of textbook has more information on the interface between client and service 
    
// Endpoints coded in WSDL 
     An ASP .Net endpoint is the port to the method exposed through a markup of contract in program
     WCF endpoint contains ABC: Address (where), Binding (how), Contract (What) 
     Different development tools (.asmx, .svc, and others) have different structures, but contain the same basic information 
     All are coded in WSDL

// Exersice to Develop a basic WCF service and clients 
    - Chapter 3 Section 3.2.1 PowerPoint slides 9 - 17 
     Developing a Service using WCF tools (Review)
     Developing a WCF service using template
     Hosting the service using IIS Express Server
     Developing a console application to consume the WCF service
     Developing WCF Service with Self-Hosting

// NOTES 
    - A service contract referers to the interface
    - Implement service contract behaviour in svc.cs file
